**Description**

This stock-taking and inventory management program was built by using OOP in Python.

It is coded for warehouses that reads a text file which includes the items in stock and allows the user 

to perform a range of functions on objects generated from the file.

It provides the user to view all items in stock
	             to search item by product code
	             to calculate the total value per item
	             to find the item with the highest quantity in stock
	             to re-stock the item with the lowest quantity in stock
	             to capture data about a specific item
